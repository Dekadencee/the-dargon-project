Pattern 1: Watch FS

Pattern 2: Trigger resolution/compilation
  1) Get AIR Client directory layout at launcher init
  2) Run modification resolution asap (potentially with messy state between two air client patches)
       DIM Changes: File1 -> File2
  3) On client start, begin game resolution and compilation
       DIM Changes: Release Manifest -> Release Manifest
                    Archive -> Archive
        ArchiveDat Section -> File Section

Additional Notes: 
Began DerpyLifecycleServiceImpl which will hook together LeagueSessionWatcherService and future modification service.
Need modification service to expose ResolveClient and ResolveGame methods for modification objects.

Copied over old file resolution to libdnode.Resolution.Resolver
