# The Dargon Project

Dargon is NOT FEATURE COMPLETE nor FULLY FUNCTIONAL! See the Issue Tracker for more information.

## What is The Dargon Project?
To start off, we figured long ago that "The Dargon Project" doesn't really mean much (it just encompasses a ton of other projects), so I'll probably rename this repository to the-dargon-client before the sun explodes.

Oh yeah, and our website's [dargon.io](http://www.dargon.io) =)

### What is The Dargon Client?
In a nutshell, The Dargon Client facilitates the safe installation of League of Legends modifications. We are unique in that we apply modifications in-memory; no game data is directly overwritten, which prevents client data corruption. We hope to support other games in the future.

## Building The Dargon Client
In the short-term, The Dargon Client only runs on Windows.

Building and starting Dargon involves setting up [dargon-developer-scripts](//github.com/the-dargon-project/dargon-developer-scripts) and running `dargonBuild` followed by `dargonStartNestAndCore`. You can find more detailed information [on our wiki](http://wiki.dargon.io/Developer_Setup).

Dargon is NOT FEATURE COMPLETE! That is, you cannot properly install League of Legends modifications with it yet.
